# Yamanotes

Yamanotes/山ノーツ \([jamanoʊts]) is a simple web app that can play the [departure melodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_melody) of each station on the [JR Yamanote Line/山手線](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line) on the couter-clockwise (内回り) loop!

You could use it for ambience or to reimagine your commute, but it was designed as a companion app to the PS4 game [*電車でGO！！はしろう山手線　Densha de GO!! Hashirou Yamanote-sen*](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9B%BB%E8%BB%8A%E3%81%A7GO!#%E9%9B%BB%E8%BB%8A%E3%81%A7GO!!_%E3%81%AF%E3%81%97%E3%82%8D%E3%81%86%E5%B1%B1%E6%89%8B%E7%B7%9A), so players can trigger the missing departure melodies before leaving each station.
